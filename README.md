# InchWorm

InchWorm is an award-winning[^1] movement system developed by Free Of Charge over the 2022-2023 FTC POWERPLAY season.
The goal of InchWorm is to make the process of coding autonomous as painless as possible.
InchWorm uses pose exponentiation and forward kinematics in order to track the robot's position over time.
Then, it uses [PID controllers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_ZMqViNKBk) to respond to errors in this position.

This repository functions as a quickstart for new FtcRobotController projects integrated with InchWorm, similar to the roadrunner quickstart.

For tuning instructions, please read [TUNING.md](TUNING.md)

For any questions, please reach out to Plano West Robotics or create an issue on this repository.
